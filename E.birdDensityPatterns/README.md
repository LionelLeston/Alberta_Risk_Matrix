# Describing bird density
## Part of: Mig Birds Matrix / BC VRI models 

Refer to the master README one folder up from here for the broader context. 

This step in the workflow is about describing bird density as a function of forest attributes used to rank the forest stands. 

It requires bird counts mapped to forest stand types (ForIDs), QPAD offsets, and stand ranks for each possible forest stand type.
