### NICOLE SUGGESTS WE MOVE THIS README TEXT TO THE SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL FOLDERS CORRESPONDING TO EACH 

Folder B:
[THIS DESCRIPTION HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE README.MD FOR FOLDER B]

Folder C:
[THIS DESCRIPTION HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE README.MD FOR FOLDER B]

Folder D:
Compare ranks in spatial file to those in matrix format file. Examine rank patterns among subregions, stand types, age classes, and timber productivity ratings.

Folder E:
Predict densities of birds (total count of all species per count) in different ForestID classes after accounting for study methods and probability of detecting individual birds. Compare predicted densities among subregions, stand types, age classes, and timber productivity ratings.

Folder F: Validate how well the rank matrix predicts densities of birds in each ForestID and based on different variables of use to foresters.
