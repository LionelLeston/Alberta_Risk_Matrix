# Steps to take in data quality-checking

Folder B:
Save attribute table from FORSITE risk matrix as multiple .csv files, making sure that all records are accounted for. Combine the files in R and create a ForestID identifier for all polygons exhibiting a specific combination of subregion, stand type, age class, and timber productivity rating. Perform a gap analysis by assigning all Alberta point counts to polygons and ForestIDs based on the point count locations. Also create a separate file of qualitative ranks assigned to each ForestID.

Folder D:
Compare ranks in spatial file to those in matrix format file. Examine rank patterns among subregions, stand types, age classes, and timber productivity ratings.

Folder E:
Predict densities of birds (total count of all species per count) in different ForestID classes after accounting for study methods and probability of detecting individual birds. Compare predicted densities among subregions, stand types, age classes, and timber productivity ratings.

Folder F: Validate how well the rank matrix predicts densities of birds in each ForestID and based on different variables of use to foresters.
